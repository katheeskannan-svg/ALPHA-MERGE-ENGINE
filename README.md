Simple static portfolio scaffold

How to preview

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use Live Server).

Files

- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — small JS for contact form

Next steps

1. Replace placeholders (name, bio, projects, email) in `index.html`.
2. Tell me your preferred color scheme and any project links; I can fill them in.
3. I can help deploy to GitHub Pages if you want.

Project links added:

Profile image

Place your profile image (the attachment you uploaded) at `portfolio/assets/profile.jpg` so the site will display it in the hero section.

Preview locally

From the `portfolio/` folder you can run a simple local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
